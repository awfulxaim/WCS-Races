Adaptive Response System
10/20/30/40/50/60/70/80% chance when you are hit to reduce your movement speed by 20% for 3 seconds. For that duration you get 6/8/10/12/14/16/18/20% chance to evade. When you evade, add 0-5 extra damage on hit, rolled randomly, to your next attack. Hits you take during this duration refresh the duration, but evaded hits do not refresh the duration.

100% chance on death to respawn at the location you died at 1-30 seconds later, rolled randomly. A message appears in chat telling you how long until your next respawn when you die. You can respawn a maximum of 4/5/6/7/8/9/10/25 times per round. If an enemy is within 200 units of the location you died when you would respawn, you respawn back at your spawn point instead.
