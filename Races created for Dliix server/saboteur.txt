Saboteur

You deal 90% less damage with guns and knives, but you get a random primary and secondary weapon every round.

Booby Trap
Anyone, even restricted races, can pick up the guns you are given when you spawn or guns you manufacture with your ultimate. When a gun you held is dropped on the ground it deals 2/4/6/8/10 damage per second to enemies in a 200 unit radius of it. This effect is applied to any gun you pick up. When an enemy picks up a gun you've dropped they take 20/40/60/80/100 damage and drop the gun. The AoE damage does not apply to guns dropped on bomb sites and that effect is lost if/when an enemy picks up that gun.

Overgassed
Enemies within 550/600/650/700/750 units of you take 1/2/3/4/5 damage when they shoot a pistol, rifle, or SMG; 4/5/6/7/8 damage when they shoot a sniper rifle; and 6/7/8/9/10 damage when they shoot a shotgun.

Damaged Magazine
Enemies within 300/350/400/450/500 units of you have a 35/45/55/65/75% chance of losing 3 more rounds out of their magazine when they shoot.

Manipulated Grenades
When an enemy picks up a grenade you have dropped, it goes off and they do not get that grenade: HE grenades explode, Flashbangs pop, molotovs and incendiaries drop fire, smokes pop smoke, decoys beacon the enemy for 20 seconds. When you throw instead of drop a grenade: HE grenades deal 5/10/15/20/25 extra damage, Flashbang duration is increased by .5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds, molotovs and incendiaries burn enemies for 1 seconds on hit (this doesn't stack or refresh), smokes poison enemies who enter it dealing 1/1/2/2/3 damage every 2 seconds for 6 seconds, decoys explode when they finish making gun sounds dealing 50 damage to enemies in a 200 unit radius.

Prismatic Barrier (ability)
You spawn with 60/70/80/90/100% invisibility. When you shoot/attack lose that invisibility for .5 seconds. When you are shot/attacked while invisible, evade that hit and lose that invisibility for 1 second. Pressing ability gives teammates in a 150 unit radius of you your current level of invisibility while they stay in that radius of you for 1/2/3/4/5 seconds or until they shoot, whichever happens first. 45/40/35/30/25 second cooldown.

Manufacture Weapons (ultimate)
If you have no guns you are given a new primary and secondary weapon. If you have a primary or secondary, primary or secondary weapons you have are thrown far in the direction you are aiming when you activate this. 30/25/20/15/10 second cooldown.
