Noxious Slipstream
When an enemy enters a 225 unit radius of you, you gain a slipstream stack, which gives you 20% increased movement speed for 2 seconds. these stacks refresh for as long as an enemy stays in that radius. if an enemy has stayed in that radius for 2 seconds, you gain another stack. all stacks refresh upon getting a new stack. An enemy can only grant you a stack once every 2 seconds. this stacks up to 25 times.

Poison Trail (toggle)
Lose 10 armor per second. you create 180 unit radius smoke clouds around you every 1 second or 90 units you move whichever comes first. these clouds last 3.25 seconds. enemies who enter the smoke cloud are poisoned, taking 1/2/3/3/4/5 damage per .5 second for 2 seconds. while they are in the radius of one of these clouds that duration is refreshed constantly. pressing walk toggles this on or off.
