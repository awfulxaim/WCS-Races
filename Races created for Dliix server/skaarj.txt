[Bunnyhop]
Hold down space to bunnyhop. explosions from any source (others grenades, your grenades, your rockets) push you away from them

[Advanced Technology]
Right clicking with the glock makes it full auto instead of burst.
-------
Shooting a player with the scout knocks them back. Right clicking with the scout does not zoom, instead, it fires a slow moving rocket phys object. if the rocket collides with anything it explodes dealing 55 damage. if you shoot the rocket with your scout it explodes and deals 85 damage instead.
-------
The negev has all of its ammo in its first mag instead of having reserve ammo. right clicking with the negev fires 50% faster but you have the same accuracy as if you were moving.
-------
right clicking with the mag-7 fires an HE grenade that explodes on impact instead.
-------
the scar-20 has 50 ammo in its mag and no reserve ammo.
-------
left clicking with the awp does not shoot, instead it fires a fast moving rocket phys object that explodes when it collides with anything dealing 110 damage to any enemy in a 100 unit radius of the explosion. right clicking throws a grenade that deals 120 damage.
-------
When you throw a decoy you can right click with a decoy in your hand to teleport instantly to wherever the thrown decoy is. Decoys do not activate but instead sit wherever they stopped for up to 60 seconds. only 1 decoy can be sitting at a time. you get a decoy as soon as you throw the previous one.
-------
right click knife attacks deal no damage, instead holding down right click charges your knife up. when an enemy enters a 75 unit radius of you while you are holding down right click, they take damage equal to 33 * the number of seconds you have held down right click up to a max of 135 damage.
-------
While you have more than 100 armor you take 75% reduced damage. While you have 150 or more armor, you take damage to your armor instead of your health.
