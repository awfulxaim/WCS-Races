Rail Gun

Famas and knife only.

Gravi-Boost JumpCore Boots
You spawn with 35/45/55/60/70% reduced gravity.

Rail Gun
In automatic mode, when you hold down left click the famas charges for 1 second before firing a single bullet which penetrates walls. This shot deals 50 damage to the chest or stomach, 25 to the arms and legs, and 300 to the head and has reduced recoil with each level in this skill (no recoil/perfect accuracy at max). In burst mode, the famas always has standing recoil and your shots penetrate up to 1/2/2/3/4 walls. (thinking maybe it might be easier to make the burst shots just travel a certain distance which increases with levels and ignores obstacles completely.)

your charged shots leave a thick orange beam for .85 seconds and a small fire where they land.
your burst shots leave a thick light blue beam for .85 seconds and a small fire where they land.

Back Blast
While firing charged shots blue sparks are emitted from your back. enemies in a 100 unit cone behind you take 5/10/15/20/25 damage and are bashed and flashed for .5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds.

Static Charge
10/20/30/40/50% chance when hit while charging the Rail Gun to paralyze the enemy for .25/.5/.75/1/1.25 seconds.

Smoking Crater
6/12/18/24/33% chance on hit to burn the enemy for 1.5 seconds. (aka 15 damage over 1.5 seconds.)

Gravity Assist (ultimate)
You get a decoy grenade, when you throw the grenade wherever it activates it creates a 150 unit radius blue and gray misty sphere. when you shoot that sphere with your burst shots the nearest enemy to that sphere within a 600/650/700/750/800 unit radius takes damage as though they were shot directly. a light blue line is drawn from the sphere to that enemy. Smoking crater can proc on these hits. The Gravity Assist Sphere lasts 4 seconds. 28/26/24/22/20 second cooldown.
