Nerif, The Oracle

Fortune's End
While Oracle is standing still and not attacking he charges up Fortune's End. Once charged for 3 seconds Oracle's next attack will deal 8/15/23/30 damage to the enemy and all enemies in ward range of that enemy. All affected enemies also are purged of ALL buffs, debuffs, dots, hots, etc.

Fate's Edict
ability1: Target player (or self) is disarmed. That player is also purged of debuffs, becomes ward, ability, and ult immune, and takes 50% increased damage from attacks. 14 second CD.

Purifying Flames
ability2: Target player (or self) is dealt 9/18/27/36 damage per second for 9 seconds. That same player is also healed for 2/3/4/5 HP per second for the same duration at the same time. If cast on a teammate or yourself, the damage can only bring you to 1 HP and cannot kill you. This ability stacks with itself. 3 second CD.

False Promise
