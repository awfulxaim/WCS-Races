Red Steps (ultimate)
Set your speed to 1.4/1.8/2/2.5 and render effect to 16 (16: Hologram (Distort + "distance fade")/(in all games since ) Fade In (instant; not very useful outside of code)) for 2/3/4/5 seconds. for that duration you leave a trail of red mist behind you and make no footstep sounds (es_setplayerprop server_var(wcs_userid) CBasePlayer.m_fFlags 4). Jumping cancels this effect early. 15 second cooldown.
