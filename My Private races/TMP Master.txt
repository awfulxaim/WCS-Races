TMP Master

4 skills with 8 ranks per skill

Spawns with and is restricted to Knife and TMP (with unlimited ammo)

AP Rounds: Has 40% chance to receive 25% of damage done back as health, to a max HP of 200 (rank 1: 30% chance for 5% damage, rank 2: 30% for 10% damage, rank 3: 35% for 15% damage, rank 4: 35% for 20% damage, rank 5: 40% chance for 25% damage) (The health gain would be 100% of damage added)
Sit Still: Has unblinding teleport, like the Human Alliance's, that has a 40% chance to deal 15 AoE damage and stun for .75 seconds where the teleport began from (has no cooldown) (rank 1: 10% chance, rank 2: 20% chance, and so on.) (ability)
Clutch Player: Has 40% chance that, while crouched, you become totally invisible (rank 1: 10%, rank 2: 20%, rank 3: 40%, rank 4: 50%, rank 5: 60%)
No Pressure: Has 75% Evasion for 4 seconds (rank 1: 10% for 5, rank 2: 20% for 5, and so on.) (ultimate)

With vampiric damage for lack of inital HP.
The Teleport is it's main skill which gives it the ability to trump most knife races, which it would otherwise be weak against because of it's lack of speed.
Chance to become invisible while crouched gives it the ability to stealth when in a clutch situation.
75% evasion for 5 seconds for those last ten seconds of the match when you may need to defuse or plant the bomb without getting headshotted.

I'd like for two of my skills to have an animation, "No pressure" and "Sit Still".
"No Pressure" should cause the character to quickly flash white on each evaded shot.
"Sit Still" should leave a Fiery ring (like the pit of malice from Pit Lord) around the AoE damaged area when activated.
