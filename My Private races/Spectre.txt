I'll post the ghost race first so you can compare, because this race is supposed to be a higher lvl version of it.

Ghost Lvl 350 (6 skills / 8 lvls)

lockdown
cloaking
arm nuke
launch nuke
ocular implants
moebius factor

Spectre lvl 700 (8 skills / 8 levels)

Lockdown- Same
Cloaking- *look below*
Ocular Implants- Same
Arm nuke- Same (ability 2)
Moebius Factor- Same
Tesla Effect- Dark ritual from Lich (ability)
Fractal Point- *look below*
Launch Nuke- Same (ultimate)

Cloaking- Activates as soon as launch nuke is activated, cloaks you like Ghost, lasts until nuke has exploded.
Fractal Point- 15% chance on death to give player $4500, or 30% chance to respawn (only once per round), when maxed and cannot do both.










Spectre lvl 700 (6 skills / 8 levels)

Spawns with and is restricted to USP and Scout.

Lockdown & Tesla Effect- Lockdown + Impetus from Oblivion
Ocular Implants- Same
Arm nuke- *look below* (ability 2)
Moebius Factor- Same
Cloak & Launch Nuke- Same, *look below for cloaking* (ability)
Fractal Point- *look below* (ultimate)

Cloak & Launch Nuke- Cloak activates as soon as launch nuke is activated, cloaks you like Ghost, lasts until nuke has exploded. 100% invisibility while activated.
Arm Nuke- Same as before but with no cost. Can only be activated once each time you spawn. Would be possible to nuke twice in a round if you respawn.
Fractal Point- 15% chance on death to give player $4500, and 30% chance to respawn (only once per round), when maxed and cannot do both.

I think my nuke should be ability because the race really isn't OP at all, and if Vanilla Ice can get wisp explosion as an ability, I can get a once per spawn nuke as an ability.
The 100% invis on the cloaking is the same as ghost.
Third, Impetus makes the race more like a 700 race, don't try to take it away from me.
The Cooldown on the nuke is until the next time the player spawns that's why it is costs no money, you can only do once every time you spawn.
I want Fractal Point to spawn me back in my spawn, not where I died.
