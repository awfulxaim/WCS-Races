This is a list of races designed or re-designed by me for use on WCS servers. If you choose to code and use a race please credit me as the designer somewhere. You can either link this github page, or just attach my name in the race info, or even just in your forum post or announcement for when the race is added to your server if you do that kind of thing. Just so long as you don't pretend you made it.

Many but not all of these races are untested and have never been balanced. some of the balanced and tested races are in the WCSAZ race folder, others are spread throughout the rest of the races and are not labeled in any way to differentiate them, sorry. Races that are balanced and tested may not be balanced and tested to work for your server, there are any number of balancing changes or races that you or your admin/server owner made that would completely change the balance.

There are some duplicates or similar races. This is usually because a race was adapted or redesigned from one server to the next over the years.

I apologize for some race's skills referencing skills from other races with little to no explanation as to which race or what that skill does. Most, if not all, of those skills should be from a race somewhere else in this repository.

If you have questions, you can message me on discord (awful_) or steam (https://steamcommunity.com/id/AwfulxAim/)
